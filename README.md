# Commit message hook
> A hook will **force** you to create proper commit message including commit **subject** and **body**.
> No one line commits are allowed (body is required to fill in).

## Usage
Please move `commit-msg.sh` script into `.git/hooks` directory in the root of the current project:
```bash
mv commit-msg.sh .git/hooks
```

Then try to commit your changes. It will not allow you commit changes if:
  - Subject commit contains `Merge` word
  - Subject commit starts from lower case letter
  - Subject commit doesn't contain at least 3 words (only letters and digits allowed)
  - Commit doesn't contain a body (should start from line 3)
  - Last line does not contain a issue task

Commit sample:

```text
Commit message sample:
Subject to be committed

Body task description to be committed

ISSUE-11
```
